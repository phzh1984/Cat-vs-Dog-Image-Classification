# Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classification

Overview

This repository contains code for an image classification algorithm that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. The algorithm is trained on a dataset comprising 25,000 images of cats and dogs and is designed to predict the labels for the test set.

Problem Statement

The task involves creating an algorithm that can automatically classify whether an image contains a cat or a dog. While this might be a straightforward task for humans, it poses a challenge for computers.

Dataset

The training archive consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs. The algorithm is trained on these files, and predictions are made for the test set, contained in test1.zip. The labeling convention is as follows: 1 represents a dog, and 0 represents a cat.
